## FAQ

### What is Script Kit?

Script Kit is an open-source dev tool for creating, running, editing, and sharing scripts.

These scripts can run in the Kit.app, the Terminal, GitHub actions, package.json scripts, webhooks, or pretty much anywhere.

### Community of Scripters?

The main goal of Script Kit is to build a community of people who love to script away the frictions of their day! ü•∞

### What are Kit.app, kit, and kenvs?

- Kit.app - The Kit.app provides a UI for your scripts. The app is "script-driven" meaning that every time you launch the app, you're really launching a script. The main menu, even though complex, is a script you could write.

- kit - "kit" is the sdk of Script Kit

  - A bundle of JavaScript common libs wrapped by an API to make writing scripts easier (`get`, `download`, `replace`, `outputFile`, etc)
  - APIs for interacting with your OS (`edit`, `focusTab`, `say`, `notify`, etc)
  - APIs for interacting with Kit.app and Terminal (`arg`, `env`, etc)
  - Scripts and utils for app setup, managing kenvs, parsing scripts, etc

- kenvs - Kit Enviroments (AKA "kenv") are directories that contain a "scripts" directory. If you point "kit" at a "kenv", kit will parse the scripts and give you tools to simplify running and managing them.

## Terminal Tools

### Add ~/.kit/bin to $PATH

<!-- description: Select profile and append ~/.kit/bin to $PATH -->
<!-- value: cli/add-kit-to-profile.js -->
<!-- enter: Select Profile -->

> This is similar to VS Code's "Add `code` to path"

You can run the `kit` CLI from your terminal with

```bash
~/.kit/bin/kit
```

but this option will allow you run the CLI with:

```bash
kit
```

> If you're familiar with adding to your `.zshrc`, just add `~/.kit/bin` to your PATH.

The `kit` CLI will allow you to run, edit, etc scripts from your terminal.

### Add kenv Executables to $PATH

<!-- description: Select profile and append ~/.kenv/bin to $PATH -->
<!-- value: cli/add-kenv-to-profile.js -->
<!-- enter: Select Kenv -->

Each time you create a script, Script Kit also generates a command based on the name you can run from the terminal.

If you create a script named `list-downloads`, then Script Kit creates a `~/.kenv/bin/list-downloads` executable.

Then you can run the command like so in the terminal:

```bash
~/.kenv/bin/list-downloads
```

This will walk you through running the command without the full path:

```bash
list-downloads
```

### Generate bin Files

<!-- description: Recreate all the terminal executables -->
<!-- value: cli/create-all-bins.js -->
<!-- enter: Create bins -->

If you manually manage files in the `scripts` dir (instead of using Kit.app or the `kit` CLI) you may run into the scenarios where you have to re-generate all the `bin` executables. This will do that for you.

## View Automatic Scripts

### View Scheduled Scripts

<!-- description: View and edit upcoming jobs -->
<!-- value: cli/schedule.js -->
<!-- enter: Open Schedule -->

Use cron syntax to run scripts on a schedule:

```js
// Schedule: */10 * * * * *
```

> Note: these scripts must not include `arg` or they will time out after 10 seconds


### View System Event Scripts

<!-- description: View and edit system event scripts -->
<!-- value: cli/system-events.js -->
<!-- enter: Open System Events -->

This menu shows scripts that run on system events.

Add the `System` metadata to run your script on a system event

```js
// System: unlock-screen
```

Available events:

- suspend
- resume
- on-ac
- on-battery
- shutdown
- lock-screen
- unlock-screen
- user-did-become-active
- user-did-resign-active
- Read about the available events [here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/power-monitor#events)

> Note: YMMV based on your specific machine setup.

### Theme Selector

Select from a variety of themes. Mostly a work in progress. We'll support community themes in the future. ‚ù§Ô∏è

<!-- description: Preview Themes -->
<!-- value: pro/theme-selector.js -->
<!-- enter: Open Theme Selector -->


### Change Script Kit Shortcut

<!-- description: Change the shortcut to open Script Kit -->
<!-- value: cli/change-main-shortcut.js -->
<!-- enter: Change -->

Don't like `cmd+;`? Change it here!

### Add/Change a Script Shortcut

<!-- description: List scripts with shortcuts, then prompt to change -->
<!-- value: cli/change-shortcut.js -->
<!-- enter: List Scripts -->

This list all the scripts and allows you to add a shortcut to it.

You can manually add shortcuts to scripts like so:

```js
// Shortcut: cmd option g
```

This menu will manage that for you


### Change Editor

<!-- description: Change the editor used to open scripts -->
<!-- value: cli/change-editor.js -->
<!-- enter: Select -->

This will re-prompt you to pick an editor from your PATH by updating your kenv `.env`.

You can always manually change the editor that Script Kit uses to open files in `~/.kenv/.env`.

The following would use `code` (assuming is on the "PATH").

```bash
KIT_EDITOR=code
```

If `code` isn't on your PATH, you can add the full path to the editor.

### Clear Kit Prompt Cache

<!-- description: Clear the positions and sizes of script prompts -->
<!-- value: cli/kit-clear-prompt.js -->
<!-- enter: Clear Cache -->


Each time you move or resize the prompt around for your scripts, Script Kit will store the position and size. If you want to reset the position of you prompts back to the centered defaults, then run this command.

```js
let express = await npm("express")
```

### Switch to JavaScript Mode

<!-- description: Set .env KIT_MODE=js -->
<!-- value: cli/switch-to-js.js -->
<!-- enter: Switch to JS -->

Prefer JavaScript for your scripts? Hit _Enter_!

### Switch to TypeScript Mode

### Sync $PATH from Terminal to Kit.app

<!-- description: Set .env PATH to the terminal $PATH -->
<!-- value: cli/sync-path-instructions.js -->
<!-- enter: Sync PATH -->

Have a command that's working in your terminal, but doesn't work when you call it with Script Kit?

Use this to sync up your "PATH" from your terminal to the "PATH" that Script Kit will use.

You can manually edit a `PATH` value any time in `~/.kenv/.env`

### Check for Update

<!-- description: Check for an update to Kit.app -->
<!-- value: cli/update.js -->
<!-- enter: Check for Update -->

Kit.app will check for updates each time your machine wakes from sleep. But if you heard about an update and just can't wait, trigger this command to grab it.

### Disable Automatic Update Check

<!-- description: Disable automatic update checks -->
<!-- value: cli/disable-auto-update.js -->
<!-- enter: Disable -->

Add the following to your `.env` to disable automatic update checks:

```bash
KIT_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=true
```

### Disable Telemetry

<!-- description: Disable telemetry -->
<!-- value: cli/disable-telemetry.js -->
<!-- enter: Disable -->

Kit.app reports anonymous open, error, prompt type, and quit events to help improve the app. If you'd like to disable this, add the following to your `.env`:

```bash
KIT_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true
```

### Select Default Display

<!-- description: Always open Kit on a specific display -->
<!-- value: config/set-default-display.js -->
<!-- enter: Select Default Display -->

Force the prompt to always open on a specific display.
